# Arduino-Projects
Welcome to my Arduino Projects repository! This collection showcases my learning progress in computer engineering, starting with basic LED circuits and culminating in more advanced projects like the 4x4 LED Matrix. Each project builds upon the previous one, demonstrating my growing skills in electronics, circuit design, and programming.
